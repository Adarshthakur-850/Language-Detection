# Language Detection

A simple and efficient web application that detects the language of a given text input using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project identifies the language from a predefined list and displays the detected language with confidence.

---

## 🧠 About

Language Detection is a Python-based tool that takes user text and tells which language it belongs to. It leverages NLP techniques and language profiles to accurately identify the language of short and long text inputs.

This project is ideal for:
- Language analysis
- Text preprocessing in multilingual pipelines
- Chatbots and translation systems
- NLP research and learning

---

## 🚀 Features

✔ Detects the language of any text query  
✔ Fast and accurate with support for multiple languages  
✔ Clean CLI / Web interface (mention here based on your UI)  
✔ Easy to integrate into other Python projects

---

## 📌 Supported Languages

List of languages the model can detect (update based on your project):

- English
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Hindi
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Dutch
- Russian

_(You can add more depending on the language library you used)_

---

## 🧩 How It Works

The project uses rule-based language profiles and token analysis to compare the input text against known patterns. Based on similarity scores, it predicts the most likely language.

_(Alternatively: If using a package like `langdetect` or `langid`, mention that here.)_
